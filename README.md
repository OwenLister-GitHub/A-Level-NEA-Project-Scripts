# A-Level-NEA-Project-Scripts

**All the files in this GitHub repository are scripts that I wrote/created in C#, within Unity to create a 2D pixel, singleplayer, platformer video game.**

This video game was my A-Level computer science NEA (Non-Exam Assessment) project which also involved lots of documentation
of any errors or problems I encountered while developing the game, design decisions I made for usability, stakeholder requirements and their involvement in the 
development, tesing and evaluation phases, success criteria for my game (so I could measure my success and break my game down into it's core elements) and
some other elements of documentation.

Each script is well-commented and details the purpose of the script at the top (the session information also detailed at the top is in reference to my documentation,
and when I created and last edited the script).  

Thank you for looking at my repository
